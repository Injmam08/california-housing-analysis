#Analysis of California's 1990 housing market using census data#


This repository contains an analysis of California's housing market in 1990 using census data from Kaggle. The dataset includes median house value, median income, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, and ocean proximity. The analysis explores statistical summaries, correlations, and insights into how income levels and housing attributes influence home prices. Key findings include the strong correlation between total rooms, bedrooms, and households, the tendency of older houses to have fewer rooms, and the impact of income on property values. This project is useful for real estate trend analysis, data exploration, and housing market research
